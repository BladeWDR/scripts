## Scripts

A public repository of scripts that I have either created or adapted and find useful.

Feel free to take whatever you like, but use any of these at your own risk.

### Bash

**backup-immich.sh** - script to dump your immich database to a file. Useful for running in a cron job.

### Powershell

**system-init.ps1** - script that installs chocolatey, then uses choco to install some common apps, the CaskaydiaCove nerd font, and changes the default terminal font to the nerd font.

**DattoRMMInstall.ps1** - Installs Datto RMM agent.

**Enable-Disable-MFA.ps1** - Toggles user based MFA in 365 on and off.

**Add-Delegate.ps1** - adds the user as a delegate of a specified mailbox in office 365.

### PHP

**export-bookstack-to-markdown.php** - NOT WORKING YET - exports your bookstack wiki pages into a file structure as markdown or pdf files.
